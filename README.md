# Resonance Grand -- Model D Concert Grand
## Introduction
This Kontakt virtual instrument library is sampled by Xinghai (星海) Piano -- Model D (1994).

This piano is fully sampled not by me. The source is [here](http://www.bianquzy.com/rg/), 
and its introduction is written in
[document](https://github.com/RobertBoganKang/Resonance_Grand__Model_D_Concert_Grand/blob/master/src/Documentation/%E8%AF%B4%E6%98%8E.pdf).

This virtual instrument is reconstructed by myself. It is a little bit buggy, but this is what I can do currently.

The demo files is in [here](https://github.com/RobertBoganKang/Resonance_Grand__Model_D_Concert_Grand/tree/master/src/Documentation).

I upload these files mainly for experimental purposes. Some project may refer to this repository.
## Usage
Please extract the compressed sample files (.rar) to the same folder it contain.
